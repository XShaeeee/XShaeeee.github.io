**Hi there, I'm Xueyin/Shae Liang** üôå

  I am a master student at [School of Earth Sciences and Resources](https://sesr.cugb.edu.cn), [China University of Geosciences, Beijing](https://www.cugb.edu.cn/)(CUGB), majoring in Geology. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Geochemistry from CUGB, where I developed a solid foundation in earth sciences. Additionally, I have completed a minor in Economics from the [National School of Development](https://www.nsd.pku.edu.cn) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn)(PKU), and I graduated with this dual academic background.

  Currently, I'm conducting my Master's project under the supervision of Professor [Wei Wang](https://scholar.cugb.edu.cn/scholar/scholarDetail/2136.shtml) within the Precambrian-CUGB research group. My research primarily focuses on the petrogenesis and geodynamic regime of late Neoarchean mantle-derived volcanic rocks from the Jiaobei terrane. The aim is to integrate field characteristics, rock assemblages, petrogenesis, and mantle properties to explain the dynamic processes of the Neoarchean in the North China Craton.


**My research interests include**
- Precambrian Geology
- Mantle properties
- Machine learning
- Thermodynamic modeling
- Casual inference
