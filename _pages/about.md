**Hi there, I'm Xueyin/Shae Liang** üôå

  I am a master student at [School of Earth Sciences and Resources](https://sesr.cugb.edu.cn), [China University of Geosciences, Beijing](https://www.cugb.edu.cn/)(CUGB), majoring in Geology. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Geochemistry from CUGB, where I developed a solid foundation in earth sciences. Additionally, I have completed a minor in Economics from the [National School of Development](https://www.nsd.pku.edu.cn) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn)(PKU), and I have a distinguished academic background, combining both social sciences and natural sciences.

  Currently, I'm conducting my Master's project under the supervision of Professor [Wei Wang](https://scholar.cugb.edu.cn/scholar/scholarDetail/2136.shtml) within the Precambrian-CUGB research group. My research primarily focuses on the petrogenesis and geodynamic regime of late Neoarchean mantle-derived volcanic rocks from the Jiaobei terrane. I am dedicated to investigating the dynamic processes of the Neoarchean in the North China Craton by integrating field characteristics, lithological assemblages, petrogenesis, and mantle properties.


**My research interests include**
- Precambrian Geology
- Mantle properties
- Machine learning
- Thermodynamic modeling
- Casual inference in Earth Sciences
